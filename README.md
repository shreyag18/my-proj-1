INTRODUCTION TO MEMORY GAME :
This is game built to test the player's memory. This game is built as a project for Google India Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree offered by Udacity and Google.  

DESCRIPTION :
Match cards in less time with less moves.


RULES :
*Click on a card
*Keep opening cards and try to remember each revealed card.
*Match each pair properly with less moves and in least time.

MY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STARTER CODE:
I manipulated the DOM with JS, altered part of the HTML and also applied styling with css.

GAME METHODOLOGY:
Each turn:

*The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
*The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
*If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
*If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
